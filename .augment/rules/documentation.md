## Scope
These guidelines apply to documentation files under `documentation/`. Implementation work under `implementation/{module-name}/` and code under `si/` follow `.augment/rules/implementation-workflow.md` and may include code snippets, function signatures, and technical specifications as needed for execution.

Within `documentation/`, write in natural language only—no code snippets.
