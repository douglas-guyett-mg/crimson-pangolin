1. Our documentation folder in natrual language is the code for this project.  It needs to be detailed enough that we can rebuild our codebase directly from it using an agentic process in any language.
2. Comprehensive tests and testing requirements are key to this.  Every part of the system should have extermely detailed test requirements and definitions.
3. This is a modular first structure with shared responsibility.  We prioritize modularity where possible, but strive to not rebuild functionality in many different places.
4. Except for the document that describes the technology stack our documentation should be technology stack independent where-ever possible.
5. Simplicity is king.  We should strive for the simplest solution that meets our needs.
